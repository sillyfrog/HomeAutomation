# Getting OpenHAB 2, ESP8266 (WeMos), Homie and HomeKit Working

This is a place for me to dump what I have figured out to get a basic setup going using HomeKit to work with a WeMos.

The "minimal-working" tag is the most basic of configurations, switching the onboard LED on and off using HomeKit (the "Home" app), via Mosquitto, to OpenHAB, then over WiFi to the WeMos.

See the Wiki for more information about what I did to get it going.

What is here is the actual configuration files I used to make this happen, something that took me a **lot** of hours to figure out (and turned out to be simple, but unfortunately there is no documentation that I could have that was good for *beginners* (someone who has never seen it before) to OpenHAB. I plan to keep updating this with what I figure out as I play with things.
